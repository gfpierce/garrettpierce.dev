## Hey.

If you're here I can tell you actually have done a fair amount of digging on this website. I'm curious as to why!  

Anyway, this is a whole website I wrote for myself in Astro, which I found to be not only an easy way to build a website, but also a quite fun way to build a website. There's also a little bit of Alpine.js sprinkled throughout the website, most notably on the uses page (dynamic tabs with nested Accordions? He's a madman!)  

I'm deploying the site today but still have a few small things to work out and settle.  

This blog will occasionally receive some new thoughts on whatever happens to be on my mind at a given moment. But for now, I just want to say one quick thing:  

Welcome, and thanks for stopping by.
